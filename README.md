## Description
This browser application takes in user-selected criteria and generates a random password based on these criterias.  The user will be able to decide password length and content, and therefore create a secure password.

## Usage
- open the link provided and click on the red "generate password" button, this activates the generator
- user will be asked a series of questions to create the following criteria:
    1. Length of the password (8 - 128 characters)
    2. whether to include lowercase characters
    3. whether to include uppercase characters
    4. whether to include numbers
    5. whether to include special characters
- Once all questions answered, a random password that meets the user-selected criteria will be pushed into the text area above the red "generate password" button.

## Developing process
- Please see script.js for application logic
- The random password is generated by the generatePassword() function
- User-selected criterias are recorded by taking the input of a series of prompt questions
- An empty variable (possibleAnswers) that will hold all possible criteria is created
- Everytime the user confirms a criteria, a corresponding string will be added to the possileAnswers variable. For example, if user confirms lowercase letters, then possibleAnswers += "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
- If the user chooses a password length that is less than 8 or greater than 128 characters, the application will prompt again to ask the user to choose a length that is in between 8 - 128 characters
- If the user denies all criteria, the generatePassword() function will run again to ensure the user selects at least one criteria
- When all prompt questions answered, possibleAnswers should hold all possible criteria the user has selected as one long string
- A new empty variable (newPassword) is created to hold value of the password that will be generated
- A for loop is created to gather specific characters from the possibleAnswers string. The loop will run the times of passwordLength, picking a random index i from 0 - passwordLength, and adding the value of possibleAnswers[i] to the newPassword variable until the loop stops
- The newly generated password is returned by the generatePassword() function and pushed to the text area above the red "generate password" buttion, where the user can copy and use
